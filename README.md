# PROJECT_SUYASHA
I created SUYASHA, a personal AI tailored for my needs. It has its own voice, neural network, database, API, and search engine. SUYASHA processes videos, images, and files offline, manages my PC tasks, saves conversations in Notepad, and accepts voice commands. It replies in text only, ensuring efficiency and privacy for personal work.
